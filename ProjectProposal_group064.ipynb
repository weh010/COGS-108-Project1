    "As we know, the automobile industry in the United States has a long and brilliant history. Cars are not only an inseparable tool for us but also an essential part of the American economy. However, the sudden arrival of covid-19 in 2020 has hit the auto industry deeply. Now, In the post-pandemic era, the auto industry has begun to recover, and auto sales increased suddenly. However, according to BLS statistics, auto-related employment did not grow as explosively as auto sales. Is this due to covid-19? Or is auto sales have no apparent relationship to automobile Industry employment?\n",
    "To figure out our answer, we will retrieve employment data related to the auto industry and auto sales data since the 1990s and analyze whether the growth and decline of each data are associated with each other.\n",
